# Renault Twizy Speaker Mounts
Speaker mounts for the Renault Twizy.  Fits 4 inch Pioneer TS-G1020F speakers and fits into the original bracket position in the roof of the car.

# Assembly
Since the bracket will need to withstand vibration, ensure that you use either nylon lock-nuts or thread-lock for all screws.

The clips are attached to the bracket using M3x16mm screws.  The speaker is attached using 4xM4 screws.  The screw-heads should be on the underside of the bracket.

See the included pictures for more details.

Note that the screw-clip has a different orientation on the left and right brackets.
